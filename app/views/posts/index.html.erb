                <p><style> .about {text-indent: 4em;} </style>I graduated from the University of Tennessee in December of 2013 with a B.S in Business Administration. Upon graduation, I immediately went to work in business operations as an Assistant Supervisor at PVH Corp. Although I didn't see operations as a life-long career, I saw a path to success that I couldn't ignore.</p>

                <p>I spent the next three and half years exploring new, potential career paths for myself while working my way up to being the Warehouse Manager at Ally Commerce (an e-commerce solutions company). After several years of searching, a friend and fellow programmer recommended that I give development a try.</p>

                <p>What initially attracted me to web development and programming was how the work coupled creativity and problem solving to build applications that didn't previously exist. I quickly discovered the supportive community of other developers and programmers on sites like Google and Stack Overflow, and I fell in deep admiration for the field. I knew it was time for me to take a leap into an exciting new career.</p>

                <p>As of September of 2017, I have completed CareerFoundry's Web Development and Career Changer courses. With my new technical skills, creative muscle, and former experiences, I am looking to join a company as a Junior Web Developer.</p>
